# Development Environment Setup

Setting up a new development environment can be a manual and time-consuming process. This project aims to simplify the process with easy instructions and scripts to automate the set-up of the following:

* GNU/Linux
* macOS
* Windows
* Docker

## Install macOS

```bash
# Installer macOS setup
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcosgomesborges/dev-setup/master/macos -o /usr/local/bin/macos && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/macos
```

This script installs setup-macos to `/usr/local` so that you donâ€™t need sudo when you macos install. It is a careful script; it can be run even if you have stuff installed to `/usr/local` already. It tells you exactly what it will do before it does it too. You have to confirm everything it will do before it starts.
